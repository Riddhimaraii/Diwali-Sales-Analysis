## 🏢 Business Problem

Festive seasons like Diwali significantly impact retail sales performance. However, businesses often struggle to answer key questions such as:

- Which products generate the highest revenue during Diwali?
- Which customer segments contribute most to total sales?
- Are there demographic patterns influencing purchasing behavior?
- Which states or regions perform best?
- How can festive sales strategies be optimized?

Without structured analysis, festive planning may rely on assumptions rather than data-driven insights.

This project aims to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence to support strategic decision-making.
